# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and materials for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, focusing on the foundational aspects of software development through effective requirement gathering and structuring.

The project simulates a real-world development scenario, where we will be focusing on the requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**. The main goal of this repository is to develop a comprehensive understanding of defining functional and non-functional requirements, designing use case diagrams, and establishing acceptance criteria.

### Objectives:
- Master requirement analysis techniques within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently document functional and non-functional requirements.
- Use tools like Draw.io for system diagramming.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria and project alignment.

This repository will serve as a step-by-step guide to completing the Requirement Analysis phase of the development process.
