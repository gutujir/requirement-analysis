# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and materials for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, focusing on the foundational aspects of software development through effective requirement gathering and structuring.

The project simulates a real-world development scenario, where we will be focusing on the requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**. The main goal of this repository is to develop a comprehensive understanding of defining functional and non-functional requirements, designing use case diagrams, and establishing acceptance criteria.

### Objectives:
- Master requirement analysis techniques within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently document functional and non-functional requirements.
- Use tools like Draw.io for system diagramming.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria and project alignment.

This repository will serve as a step-by-step guide to completing the Requirement Analysis phase of the development process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. It is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it establishes the foundation for the entire project. During requirement analysis, the development team works with stakeholders (clients, users, and project managers) to gather, clarify, and document the business and technical needs that the system must fulfill.

### Importance in SDLC:
- **Foundation for Development**: Requirement analysis is the first step in building any software product. Without clear, structured requirements, the project is at risk of misalignment with the client's goals and user needs.
- **Clear Understanding**: It helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s purpose, functionality, and constraints.
- **Defining Scope**: The requirement analysis phase helps to define what is in scope and out of scope for the project, preventing scope creep.
- **Risk Mitigation**: By identifying potential issues early in the process, requirement analysis helps mitigate the risk of project delays or failures.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Clear requirements guide the development team in allocating the necessary resources effectively, optimizing time and cost.

The goal of requirement analysis is to produce a **comprehensive set of requirements** that can guide the development process and ensure that the software meets the needs of the business and end-users.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential for the successful delivery of a software project. Below are key reasons why it plays a vital role in the SDLC:

### 1. **Ensures Clear Understanding of Business Needs**
   Requirement analysis ensures that the development team fully understands the business goals and user expectations before the development begins. By collecting and documenting requirements early, the project aligns closely with the business’s needs, ensuring that the final product addresses the right problems.

### 2. **Prevents Scope Creep**
   By defining the scope of the project from the outset, requirement analysis helps avoid scope creep—when the project's requirements change or expand without proper control. Clear and documented requirements ensure that the project stays focused on its original objectives and prevents unnecessary additions that can delay the timeline and increase costs.

### 3. **Reduces Development Costs and Risks**
   When requirements are thoroughly analyzed, potential challenges, such as technical limitations, security concerns, or regulatory issues, can be identified early. This proactive approach helps mitigate risks and reduces costly changes later in the development process, which could arise from poorly defined or misunderstood requirements.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis involves several critical activities to ensure that the project meets both business and technical objectives. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**: 
  - This is the initial phase where the development team collects information from various stakeholders, including clients, users, and business analysts. It involves gathering data about the needs, goals, and expectations for the software system. Techniques like interviews, surveys, and document analysis are commonly used in this phase.

- **Requirement Elicitation**: 
  - This activity focuses on extracting detailed requirements from stakeholders. It involves asking the right questions, facilitating discussions, and identifying any ambiguities or missing information. The goal is to clarify what stakeholders need, not just what they say they want.

- **Requirement Documentation**: 
  - Once the requirements are gathered, they are documented in a structured format. This documentation serves as a reference for the entire development process. It may include functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, use cases, and system constraints, often written in tools like Confluence or Markdown.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: 
  - This activity involves analyzing the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and feasible. In this phase, the requirements are often modeled using diagrams, flowcharts, or use case diagrams to help visualize how the system will function and interact with users and other systems.

- **Requirement Validation**: 
  - After documenting and modeling the requirements, they are reviewed with stakeholders to ensure they accurately represent the needs of the business and users. Validation helps identify discrepancies or misunderstandings early, ensuring the final system will meet the specified requirements.
 
## Types of Requirements

In requirement analysis, it is important to distinguish between **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**, as each serves a different purpose in the software development process. Below are the definitions and examples of each type of requirement for the **Booking Management System**.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the **specific behavior** or **functionality** of the system. These requirements define what the system should do and how it should behave under various conditions. They are usually driven by the needs of the business and users.

Examples of **Functional Requirements** for the Booking Management System:
- **User Registration**: The system must allow users to register by entering their personal details (name, email, phone number).
- **Booking Creation**: The system must allow users to book a service by selecting a date, time, and available service provider.
- **Booking Cancellation**: The system must allow users to cancel their bookings before a specified time.
- **Payment Integration**: The system must integrate with payment gateways to allow users to make payments for their bookings.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe the **quality attributes**, such as performance, security, usability, and scalability, of the system. These requirements define how well the system should perform its functions, rather than specifying what functions the system should perform.

Examples of **Non-functional Requirements** for the Booking Management System:
- **Performance**: The system must be able to handle 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: The system must encrypt all sensitive data, such as payment information and personal details, using SSL encryption.
- **Usability**: The system must be user-friendly and allow users to complete a booking within three minutes.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle an increase in user traffic and expand to support additional services without major rework.


## Acceptance Criteria

### What are Acceptance Criteria?

**Acceptance Criteria** are the conditions that a software product must meet in order to be accepted by the end user, client, or system owner. They define the expected behavior of the system and serve as a guide for testing to ensure the system performs as intended. Acceptance criteria are often written in the form of "Given-When-Then" statements and are crucial for validating the system's functionality during the development and testing phases.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria

- **Clarity**: They provide a clear understanding of what is expected for each feature or requirement.
- **Testability**: Acceptance criteria help define specific tests that can be executed to verify that the feature works as intended.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: They ensure that all stakeholders (including developers, testers, and business owners) agree on what constitutes a successful feature implementation.
- **Quality Assurance**: They serve as the foundation for acceptance testing, which helps to ensure that the software meets the required standards and functions as expected.

### Example of Acceptance Criteria: Checkout Feature for Booking Management System

For the **Checkout** feature in the **Booking Management System**, the acceptance criteria could be:

1. **Given** the user has selected a service and is on the checkout page, **When** they enter valid payment details, **Then** the system should process the payment and confirm the booking.
2. **Given** the user is on the checkout page, **When** they enter an invalid payment method, **Then** the system should display an error message indicating that the payment method is invalid.
3. **Given** the user has made a successful payment, **When** the payment is confirmed, **Then** the system should send a booking confirmation email to the user.
4. **Given** the user has selected a date and time for the service, **When** they confirm their booking, **Then** the system should display the service details and the payment summary before completing the transaction.

These criteria ensure that the checkout process functions as expected, allowing for thorough testing and validation of the feature.
