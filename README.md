# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and materials for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, focusing on the foundational aspects of software development through effective requirement gathering and structuring.

The project simulates a real-world development scenario, where we will be focusing on the requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**. The main goal of this repository is to develop a comprehensive understanding of defining functional and non-functional requirements, designing use case diagrams, and establishing acceptance criteria.

### Objectives:
- Master requirement analysis techniques within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently document functional and non-functional requirements.
- Use tools like Draw.io for system diagramming.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria and project alignment.

This repository will serve as a step-by-step guide to completing the Requirement Analysis phase of the development process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. It is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it establishes the foundation for the entire project. During requirement analysis, the development team works with stakeholders (clients, users, and project managers) to gather, clarify, and document the business and technical needs that the system must fulfill.

### Importance in SDLC:
- **Foundation for Development**: Requirement analysis is the first step in building any software product. Without clear, structured requirements, the project is at risk of misalignment with the client's goals and user needs.
- **Clear Understanding**: It helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s purpose, functionality, and constraints.
- **Defining Scope**: The requirement analysis phase helps to define what is in scope and out of scope for the project, preventing scope creep.
- **Risk Mitigation**: By identifying potential issues early in the process, requirement analysis helps mitigate the risk of project delays or failures.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Clear requirements guide the development team in allocating the necessary resources effectively, optimizing time and cost.

The goal of requirement analysis is to produce a **comprehensive set of requirements** that can guide the development process and ensure that the software meets the needs of the business and end-users.
